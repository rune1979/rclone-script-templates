# rclone-script-templates

Based on the the rclone_jobber.sh https://github.com/wolfv6/rclone_jobber this is 
static script templates for sync with archive, retreival of files in archive
and backup (copy) of directories.

This repo basically consists of three files. backup.sh, sync.sh and restore_from_sync_archive.sh.
There are some examples of use in the /example/ dir.
Basic understanding of rclone is a good idea, and they have a really lightweight 
and easy to understand documentation: https://rclone.org/docs/

These scripts are made for my Raspberry Pi backup server. If you by some coincidence are interested
in trying to make a Raspberry Pi backup server. You may read more about it here: https://thehotelhero.com/rclone-setup-on-raspberry-pi
